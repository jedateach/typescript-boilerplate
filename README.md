# Typescript boilerplate

This example project demonstrates how to:

- [x] Compile Typescript source into modern js, with sourcemaps
- [x] Bundle esnext js into separate umd bundles, split by module, with sourcemaps to ts files
- [ ] View in the browser with live reload + file watching
- [ ] Run tests in the browser with Testem
- [ ] Get code coverage reporting via istanbul/nyc

## TODO

Find out how to improve source maps so that `esnext` path doesn't show up
